## Getting Started

To run the example, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Obtain an [Open AI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Replace the sample fake key in the source code with your key. The fake key will not work.
2. Then execute the following line from a command prompt/shell terminal:

```bash
php prompt.php
```

## Debugging
If you want to understand what is going on, use xdebug to trace through the code as it is executing.

## Compatibility
This code was tested with PHP 7.1 to 8.2. Ensure that cURL is enabled in your php.ini file.

## Open AI Accounts
This should work with both free and paid OpenAI accounts.

Hope this guide helps you in leveraging the power of AI with PHP.
